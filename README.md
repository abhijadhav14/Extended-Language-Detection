# Extended-Language-Detection

# About the dataset:
We are using the Language Detection dataset, which contains text details for 17 different languages.

Languages are:

* English

* Portuguese

* French

* Greek

* Dutch

* Spanish

* Japanese

* Russian

* Danish

* Italian

* Turkish

* Swedish

* Arabic

* Malayalam

* Hindi

Using the text we have to create a model which will be able to predict the given language. This is a solution for many artificial intelligence applications and computational linguists. These kinds of prediction systems are widely used in electronic devices such as mobiles, laptops, etc for machine translation, and also on robots. It helps in tracking and identifying multilingual documents too.
